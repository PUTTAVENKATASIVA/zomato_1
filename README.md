Sentiment Analysis on Zomato Reviews
This project performs sentiment analysis on Zomato restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content.

Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and stemming the text data from Zomato reviews.

Feature Extraction: Converting text into numerical features using the Bag of Words model.

Model Training: Training a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment.

Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the project.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like stemming and stopword removal.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks like feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib: For data visualization (if needed).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file named Zomato.tsv. It contains two columns:

Review: The text of the restaurant review.

Liked: A binary label indicating whether the review is positive (1) or negative (0).

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-zomato.git
cd sentiment-analysis-zomato
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib
Download NLTK Data:
Run the following Python code to download the necessary NLTK datasets:

python
Copy
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
Download the Dataset:
Place the Zomato.tsv file in the root directory of the project.

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (Untitled1.ipynb) in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.

Execute each cell step-by-step to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Run as a Python Script:

Convert the notebook into a Python script if needed.

Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy
python sentiment_analysis.py
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix: To visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Accuracy Score: To measure the overall correctness of the model.

Example output:

Copy
Confusion Matrix:
[[135  25]
 [ 20 120]]
Accuracy: 85.0%
